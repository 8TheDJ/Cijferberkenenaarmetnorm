For this file i would recommend installing the libraries openpyxl, os, pandas, numpy and sys.
You can do this with the pip installer.

The best way to use this tool is to keep it on your desktop and open the folder and launch the python aplication from the folder itself
 this way you can input the norm and the max score easily and instantly get your excelfile with all the grades.

Thank you for using my tool.
